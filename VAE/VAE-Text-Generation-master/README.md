# VAE-Text-Generation
Implementation of "Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space" paper using pytorch and torchtext. Generate sentences based on imdb review dataset

## Prerequisites
* Python 2.7
* Pytorch 0.4.0
* Torchtext 0.2.0

## Data
Data can be found at ```data/imdb``` where I have splitted imdb review paras into sentences, picked those with word count more than 5 and less than 20, splitted them into train set and test set based on 7:3 ratio. In total, there are around 5.5 lakh training sentences and 2.4 lakh testing sentences

## Training
To train the model from the beginning, run:
```
python main.py
```
To resume training from a saved model, run:
```
python main.py --resume_training=True
```
## Testing
To generate samples from a saved model, run:
```
python main.py --to_train=False
```

Notice that if you try to generate a sample from model which is not trained enough, it might generate sentences with words greater than 20.

### Samples with default configuration and after 120 epochs:
&lt;sos&gt; i highly recommend this movie for horror fans. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; these are not what kids will always like. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; but for me alone 3 d enough to make it more excellent effects than the first &lt;unk&gt; &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; they still &lt;unk&gt; young children. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; so the movie has all those ways home take your parents kids to watch it. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; better on for the three for good disgusting stuff. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; there is a lot of things about the film again seem it seem like it drags along. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; when you need your health watch movies you have just seen in good movies. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; in fact it a marvel for the city of &lt;unk&gt; of humanity. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; i loved the surreal sense of music we see in the car still. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; running from the story takes an interesting and unexpected outcome. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; i like robert de niro in one of ridley scott semi &lt;unk&gt; movies ever day godzilla vs &lt;unk&gt; . &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; cruise and jolie both capture their into and are very entertaining. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; the objects have caught me in years. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; hugh jackman is a cop who ends up there with kingdom to harold and the song &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; why not waste the sorry guys &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; in fact he could not save much of a script it a musical. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; to the weird parents first impressions &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; this film is not for everybody. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; actually he is not as witty as he can be a person &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; police &lt;unk&gt; &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; his dialogue was a bit stiff and heavy of the film. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; there is not much excitement here. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; it should not be a sequel. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; controversy is a blockbuster that has gone through and that what a surprise to it. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; is there those looking united that &lt;unk&gt; missing a &lt;unk&gt; one thing &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; it might be rather confusing when the first marvel movie left to hell looked at. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; of our penguins play properly giving &lt;unk&gt; cool feeling now that too well. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; it is an incredible movie. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; and yet the characters are has a variety of charm with multi &lt;unk&gt; &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; this does not star kurt russell but &lt;unk&gt; allows him what amounts to an extended cameo. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; but when it fun for what it is. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; every single theme is the same. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; right and filled with a &lt;unk&gt; uncomfortable moments. &lt;eos&gt;  
&lt;sos&gt; there are always familiar faces in the superman 2004 . &lt;eos&gt;
